#Tech Stack

I mostly work with JavaScript, specifically Node.js in the backend with AWS as the cloud and Kafka as the queuing system. Recently, I have been tinkering with GoLang.

<!-- # Open Source Initiatives
During Hacktoberfest, I initiated a program aimed at helping beginners kickstart their journey into open-source, impacting over 1200+ beginners worldwide. Currently, I'm seeking collaboration for #50DaysOfJavaScript, a community-led open-source initiative to enhance JavaScript skills to ace the next JS interviews. Please consider joining as a participant, mentor, or a community partner. -->
